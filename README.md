Project description: This project is done to illustrate, how to design a 3.7V Lithium ion battery charger using MSP430G2553 launchpad microcontrollers. The project is broken down into the following steps

* Study the Li battery chemistry / charging and discharging process
* Create / build project specifications
* Create the project block diagram
* ( to be continued )
